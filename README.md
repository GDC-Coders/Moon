# Nitro Gen 2.0 (Now in Python)
> Old Version (dont use) --> github.com/m000000000n/Nitro-genJs

# Why and What this project is.
I made this for discord users, who sadly could not afford nitro.
It generates a nitro gift code that you are able to claim! > Not all codes will be valid, they will be checked by a bot.
You can even add webhook support to send you the codes!

# Ok Ok We get it, but how to use this?


**Also note python3 is required to use this.**

First in your terminal run `git clone https://github.com/m000000000n/NitroGen2.0/`



Then run `cd NitroGen2.0`


next, ` python3 main.py `


and thats it! you should be ready!
