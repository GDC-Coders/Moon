# Why and What this project is.
I made this for discord users, who sadly could not afford nitro.
It generates a nitro gift code that you are able to claim! 


You can even add webhook support to send you the codes!

> Not all codes will be valid, they will be checked if valid they will be sent

# Ok Ok We get it, but how to use this?


**Also note python3 is required to use this.**

First in your terminal run `git clone https://github.com/m000000000n/NitroGen2.0/`



Then run `cd NitroGen2.0`


next, ` python3 main.py `


and thats it! you should be ready! 



# You can also run on mobile devices! ios & android!



First go to replit.com


Then make a new python project


go to the terminal in the project and type `git clone https://github.com/m000000000n/NitroGen2.0`
